# Microcontrollers

I once worked on an HP1000 minicomputer used for Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). It was used for periodic testing on items. A lot of circuit interface were made, and programming done for each item that needed to be tested. This took many man hours. I was hired because of my knowledge of microcomputers and they were about to put some microcomputers in the products that they were testing. Everybody was catching up to what micro could do. So, I proposed that if we get a micro development system and build a few controller systems we would not have spent as much time on circuit design. HP like the idea because we used there first micro development system.
