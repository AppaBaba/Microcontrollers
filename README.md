# Microcontrollers
I once worked on an HP1000 minicomputer used for Automatic Test Equipment (ATE).
It was used for periodic testing on idems. A lot of circuit interface were made and programming
done for each item that needed to be tested. This took many man hours. I was hired because of
my knowledge of microcomputers and they were about to put some microcomputers in the products
that they were testing. Everybody was cactching up to what micro could do. So I proposed that
if we get a microdevelopment system and build a few contorlor systems we would not have spend
as much time on circuit design. HP like the idea because we used there frist microdevelopment system.
