Kano Pixel

The Kano Pixel is a really fun way for kids to learn how to program. Kano code is using blocks and is easy to learned. Even I had a few hours of fun with it. So what if you want to learn more advance things. Do not put your Kano Pixel on the shelf and buy another divce. The Kano Pixel is just a microcontroler and you can have more control over it and use it for what ever you want. So and if your grandchild wants to learn how to progrm, you can restore the image back to it.
